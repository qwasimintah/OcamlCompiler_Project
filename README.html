<li>Our project is able to produce arm and able to produce asml. We have also created our own intermediate langage (Jerry), because we thought it would be more interesting to program own langage to figure out what were the constraint that we wouldn't have thought to otherwise.</li>
<li>Sometimes some tests, as add_sub.out work and sometimes not, due to register allocation (which might change), <strong>as you can see here</strong>:<br><img src="images/proof.png" alt="proof"></li>

<p>From this location, you can run the following commands :</p>
<ul>
<li>make <em>to compile the project</em></li>
<li>make clean <em>to clean all the .class (and other) generated by</em> make</li>
<li>make test <em>to run the tests serie</em>
All these commands call other files located in the <strong>java folder</strong> or the <strong>script</strong> and <strong>tests</strong> folders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="for-make-test-">For make test :</h3>
<p>It process in two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>It generates the output by executing the program on every testing input file</li>
<li>It execute the test (by comparing the previously-generated) output and what we have</li>
</ul>
