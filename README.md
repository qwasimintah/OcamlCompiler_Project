Small changes have to be done



## General inforamtion
From this location, you can run the following commands :
- make *to compile the project*
- make clean *to clean all the .class (and other) generated by* make
- make test *to run the tests serie*
All these commands call other files located in the __java folder__ or the __script__ and __tests__ folders.

### For make test :
It process in two parts:
- It generates the output by executing the program on every testing input file
- It execute the test (by comparing the previously-generated) output and what we have

##### The generation-part should display something like :
![generate](images/generate.png)

##### The execution-part should display something like:

The subset of the language that is already implemented:
